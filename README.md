Android APP for Correcting Keystone Distortion in Digital Images 
The project is developing an Android application which can realized correcting Keystone Distortion in Digital Images. For example, when we put a rectangle document like a paper or a textbook on the desk. And then we use our phone or camera to take a photo of this document at an angle. Not right in front of the document. Then the document in the photo will looks like a keystone. This is due to the principle of perspective, also called perspective distortion. What we need to do is to restore the file that looks like a keystone in this photo to a normal rectangle, which is somewhat like scanning.
